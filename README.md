Development kit for the AI deck
===============================

Developing for the AI Deck of the Crazyflie requires programming three different chips, each 
requiring its own toolchain, debug setup and SDKs.

This repo provides

* a dockerfile for each chip to build a self-contained development environment for the respective chip
* example bash scripts how to run and use these docker images
* hints on how to integrate these docker images with VS Code to make debugging a breeze.
